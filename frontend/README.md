# ShopGo Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for [ShopGo](../README.md). Part of the monorepo; see the **root [README.md](../README.md)** for full setup, environment variables, and running the app.

## Quick commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build
npm run lint
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env.local` if the backend is not on the same origin (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`).
